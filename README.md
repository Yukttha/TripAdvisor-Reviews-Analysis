  <h3>I. Overview of Dataset</h3>
  <p>The dataset focuses on hotel reviews from TripAdvisor. TripAdvisor operates in the hospitality and tourism industry, where travellers (i.e., users) typically rely on the reviews made on TripAdvisor to book hotels. 

The dataset is stored in a csv file, with two variables: Review and Rating. The dataset consists of 20k reviews. The ‘Review’ variable is a string variable, and the ‘Rating’ variable is an integer variable. These variables are important to be identified and understand what they represent, as they will be used to create the following objectives, which will guide this report.</p>

<h5>Objectives</h5>
<li>To identify how are consumers’ expressions different between high-ranked reviews and low-ranked reviews.</li>
<li>To identify what are the key factors of high-ranked hotels and low-ranked hotels.</li>
<li>To identify why there may be significant differences in high-ranked reviews compared to low-ranked reviews.</li>
